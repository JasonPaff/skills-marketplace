## Reasoning

This feature request is exceptionally detailed. It explicitly references every file to create, modify, and delete by exact path. It specifies exact table columns with rendering details, defines the expanded row content exhaustively, names the filtering approach, identifies components to create and remove, search params to update, and specifies styling expectations. All referenced files have been verified to exist in the codebase and the request aligns accurately with the actual code structure.

## Enhanced Request

Original request passed unchanged to Step 1 (no clarification needed).
