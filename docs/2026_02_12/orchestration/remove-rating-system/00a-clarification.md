## Ambiguity Assessment

- **Score**: 5/5
- **Decision**: SKIP_CLARIFICATION

## Reasoning

The feature request is exceptionally thorough. It specifies every file to modify or delete across all packages (api, shared, web), names exact columns, schema fields, functions, methods, routes, components, and line numbers. It references real artifacts verified in the codebase. It clearly states the backwards-compatibility stance (none needed, pre-production), the migration strategy (edit in-place), and the verification step (clean TypeScript build with no rating references). There is nothing ambiguous about scope, approach, or implementation.

## Enhanced Request

Original request passed through unchanged (no clarification needed).
